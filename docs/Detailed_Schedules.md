## Explanations:
Site Presentations: Each site presents for max 5 minutes: That's our site, that's what we do, that's what we'd like to do in the future. Maybe also: This are the special things we have (hardware, software, ...)

Presentations marked with an asterisk (*) will be streamed via Zoom. Participant link available on request.
