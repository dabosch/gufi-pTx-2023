## Transport and Accomodation
We recommend to arrive on the day before the event. Travelling to Tübingen from the next high-speed rail or airport will take more than one hour.
All participants have to organize travel and accomodation themselves.
Recommendations for hotels will soon be added [here](Accomodation.md).

## Registration Fees
Participation will be free of charge for all invited members of `GUFI&friends`.
Participants are expected to pay for their own accomodation and travel. While some food is provided during the day, the dinner/social event at the end of day 1 will have to be paid by those participants who wish to join.
