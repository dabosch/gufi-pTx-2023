Subj: gufi pTx workshop: introduction, program, latest info

Dear {{First Name}},

It's just over one week until we meet at the gufi pTx workshop in Tübingen. Here is some information about the upcoming event.

Location of the Workshop
The majority of the workshop will be held in the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, Max Planck Ring 4, on the ground floor. The building is usually locked, so you'll need to wait for one of us to let you in. Please try to arrive on time.

Program now online
The program can be found at https://dabosch.github.io/gufi-pTx-2023/Program.html . If you are a presenter, please make sure your information is correct.

Introductions
We'd like each site to give a very brief presentation (4-5 minutes max) about their activities on the first day. If you have several groups working at one site, please try to divide the time. For the presentations, I'd like to ask you to send me your slides in powerpoint or pdf format by Friday, February 10th.

Presentations
If you are presenting during the workshop, we prefer that you send us your slides in powerpoint or pdf format by Friday, February 10. If that's not possible for you, please contact me to discuss what works for you.

Covid Tests
We plan to have covid19 self-tests available on site on a voluntary basis.  If you would like to do one, please arrive on time!

Please check the event website for updated information on how to get to the venue. If you need a parking permit for your car, please send me your license plate number. On day 1, we'll be having dinner in the city center with everyone who wants to join us. The best way to get there is by bus, details will be announced during the event.

If you have any questions please get in touch with me. I'm looking forward to meeting you in Tübingen next week.
