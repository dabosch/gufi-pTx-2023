Dear GUFI&friends pTx colleagues,

thank you for participating in our poll for finding the date of our first GUFI pTx workshop.
Taking your votes and room availabilities into account we decided to have the workshop on February 14-15 2023.

We already created a website which we will extend as information becomes available. You can find it under https://t1p.de/gufi-pTx . A registration form will follow soon.

As mentioned before we depend on presentations and workshop contributions from the community. Thanks for those of you who have already offered their help. If you have something to share please get in touch with us.

Best,
Dario & Jonas
