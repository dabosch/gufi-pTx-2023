Subj: Once again: gufi pTx workshop

Dear all,

This is probably the last email about our upcoming gufi pTx workshop that I'll send through this mailing list.

I have just sent an email to all workshop participants. If you registered but didn't get my email 5 minutes ago, please contact me so I can make sure you are registered for the event.

We will be streaming parts of the workshop via Zoom. If you can't attend in person, please send me an email and I'll send you the zoom login information shortly before the workshop starts.

Best,
Dario
