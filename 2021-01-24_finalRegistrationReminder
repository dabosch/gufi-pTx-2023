Subj: Registration for pTx workshop

Dear all,

Just a reminder that the registration deadline for our GUFI pTx workshop is January 27th! It's great to see that so many of you have already signed up for it. We are very much looking forward to this event.

You can find the workshop website with the registration link here:

Also, you are probably not yet registered if you have not received a confirmation email. I'm sending out these confirmations manually, so it may take a few hours to a day for you to receive them. Please contact me if in doubt!

I'm looking forward to seeing many of you in TÃ¼bingen soon!

Best,
Dario
